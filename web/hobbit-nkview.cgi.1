.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-nkview.cgi\fR is invoked as a CGI script via the

.SH RELATION TO BBNK PAGE
This view is a replacement for the statically generated "bbnk" page 
provided in versions of Xymon prior to version 4.2. Although the

that You switch to the newer Critical Systems view provided by this CGI.
