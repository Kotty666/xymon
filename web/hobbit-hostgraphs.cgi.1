.TH HOBBIT-HOSTGRAPHS.CGI 1 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
hobbit-hostgraphs.cgi \- CGI program to show multiple graphs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbit-hostgraph.cgi"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-hostgraph.cgi\fR
is invoked as a CGI script via the hobbit-hostgraph.sh CGI wrapper.

If no parameters are provided when invoked, it will present a form
where the user can select a time period, one or more hosts, and a
set of graphs.

The parameters selected by the user are passed to a second invocation
of hobbit-hostgraph.cgi, and result in a webpage showing a list of
graph images based on the trend data stored about the hosts.

If multiple graph-types are selected, hobbit-hostgraph.cgi will display
a list of graphs, with one graph per type.

If multiple hosts are selected, hobbit-hostgraph.cgi will attempt to
display a multi-host graph for each type where the graphs for all
hosts are overlayed in a single image, allowing for easy comparison
of the hosts.

The hostlist uses the PAGEPATH cookie provided by Xymon webpages to
select the list of hosts to present. Only the hosts visible on the
page where hobbit-hostgraph.cgi is invoked from will be visible.

The resulting graph page can be bookmarked, but the bookmark
also fixates the time period shown.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Loads the environment defined in FILENAME before executing the CGI script.

.SH BUGS
This utility is experimental. It may change in a future release of Xymon.

It is possible for the user to select graphs which do not exist. This results
in broken image links.

The set of graph-types is fixed in the server/web/hostgraphs_form template 
and does not adjust to which graphs are available.

If the tool is invoked directly, all hosts defined in Xymon will be listed.
