.TH HOBBIT-ENADIS.CGI 8 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
hobbit-enadis.cgi \- CGI program to enable/disable Xymon tests
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbit-enadis.cgi (invoked via CGI from webserver)"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBhobbit-enadis.cgi\fR is a CGI tool for disabling and enabling
hosts and tests monitored by Xymon. You can disable monitoring of
a single test, all tests for a host, or multiple hosts - immediately
or at a future point in time.

hobbit-enadis.cgi runs as a CGI program, invoked by your webserver.
It is normally run via a wrapper shell-script in the secured CGI 
directory for Xymon.

hobbit-enadis.cgi is the back-end script for the enable/disable
form present on the "info" status-pages. It can also run in
"stand-alone" mode, in which case it displays a web form allowing
users to select what to enable or disable.


.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--no-cookies"
Normally, hobbit-enadis.cgi uses a cookie sent by the browser to initially 
filter the list of hosts presented. If this is not desired, you can
turn off this behaviour by calling bb-ack.cgi with the --no-cookies
option. This would normally be placed in the CGI_ENADIS_OPTS setting in
.I hobbitcgi.cfg(5)

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Load the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.

.IP "--area=NAME"
Load environment variables for a specific area. NB: if used,
this option must appear before any --env=FILENAME option.

.SH FILES
.IP "$BBHOME/web/maint_{header,form,footer}"
HTML template header

.SH BUGS
When using alternate pagesets, hosts will only show up on the
Enable/Disable page if this is accessed from the primary page
in which they are defined. So if you have hosts on multiple
pages, they will only be visible for disabling from their
main page which is not what you would expect.
