.TH BB-FINDHOST.CGI 1 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
bb-findhost.cgi \- Xymon CGI script to find hosts
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bb-findhost.cgi?host=REGEX"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbb-findhost.cgi\fR
is invoked as a CGI script via the bb-findhost.sh CGI wrapper.

bb-findhost.cgi is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
"host=REGEX" parameter. The REGEX is a Posix regular expression (see
.I regex(7)
) describing the hostnames to look for.  A trailing wildcard is assumed on all 
hostnames - e.g. requesting the hostname "www" will match any host whose 
name begins with "www".

It then produces a single web page, listing all of the hosts that
matched any of the hostnames, with links to the Xymon webpages
where they are located.

The output page lists hosts in the order they appear in the
.I bb-hosts(5)
file.

A sample web page implementing the search facility is included
with bbgen, you access it via the URL /bb/help/bb-findhost.html.
