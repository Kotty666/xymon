.TH BB-REP.CGI 1 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
bb-rep.cgi \- CGI front-end to bbgen reporting
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "bb-rep.cgi [--noclean] [bbgen-options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbb-rep.cgi\fR
is invoked as a CGI script via the bb-rep.sh CGI wrapper.
It triggers the generation of a Xymon availability
report for the timeperiod specified by the CGI paramaters.

bb-rep.cgi is passed a QUERY_STRING environment variable with the
following parameters:

   start-mon (Start month of the report)
   start-day (Start day-of-month of the report)
   start-yr  (Start year of the report)
   end-mon   (End month of the report)
   end-day   (End day-of-month of the report)
   end-yr    (End year of the report)
   style     (Report style)
 
The following non-standard parameters are handled by the
bbgen version of bb-rep.cgi:

   suburl    (Page in report to go to, if not the top page)

The "month" parameters must be specified as the three-letter
english month name abbreviation: Jan, Feb, Mar ...

Start- and end-days are in the range 1..31; the start- and end-year
must be specified including century (e.g. "2003").

End-times beyond the current time are silently replaced with 
the current time.

The generated report will include data for the start- and end-days,
i.e. the report will begin at 00:00:00 of the start-day, and end 
at 23:59:59 of the end-day.

The "style" parameter is passed directly to 
.I bbgen(1)
and should be "crit", "non-crit" or "all". Other values result
in undefined behaviour.

All of the processing involved in generating the report is done 
by invoking 
.I bbgen(1)
with the proper "--reportopts" option.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP --noclean
Do not clean the BBREP directory of old reports. Makes the
report-tool go a bit faster - instead, you can clean up the
BBREP directory e.g. via a cron-job.

.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Load the environment from FILENAME before executing the CGI.

.IP bbgen-options
All other options passed to bb-rep.cgi are passed on to the 
.I bbgen(1)
program building the report files.
