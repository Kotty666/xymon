.TH HOBBIT-MAILACK 8 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
hobbit-mailack \- permit acknowledging alerts via e-mail
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbit-mailack --env=FILENAME [--debug]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
hobbit-mailack normally runs as an input mail-filter for the
hobbit user, e.g. by being called from the xymon users' 
.I procmailrc(5)
file. hobbit-mailack recognizes e-mails that are replies to 
.I hobbitd_alert(8)
mail alerts, and converts the reply mail into an acknowledge
message that is sent to the Xymon system. This permits an
administrator to acknowledge an alert via e-mail.

.SH ADDING INFORMATION TO THE REPLY MAIL
By default, an acknowledgment is valid for 1 hour. If you know
in advance that solving the problem is going to take longer,
you can change this by adding \fBdelay=DURATION\fR to the subject
of your mail reply or on a line in the reply message. Duration is 
in minutes, unless you add a trailing 'h' (for 'hours'), 'd' 
(for 'days') or 'w' (for 'weeks').

You can also include a message that will show up on the status-page
together with the acknowledgment, e.g. to provide an explanation for
the issue or some other information to the users. You can either
put it at the end of the subject line as \fBmsg=Some random text\fR, 
or you can just enter it in the e-mail as the first non-blank line of
text in the mail (a "delay=N" line is ignored when looking for the
message text).

.SH USE WITH PROCMAIL
To setup hobbit-mailack, create a \fB.procmailrc\fR file in
the xymon-users home-directory with the following contents:
.IP
.nf
DEFAULT=$HOME/Mailbox
LOGFILE=$HOME/procmail.log
:0
| $HOME/server/bin/hobbit-mailack --env=$HOME/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
.fi

.SH USE WITH QMAIL
If you are using Qmail to deliver mail locally, you can run hobbit-mailack
directly from a \fB.qmail\fR file. Setup the xymon-users .qmail file like this:
.IP
.nf
| $HOME/server/bin/hobbit-mailack --env=$HOME/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
.fi

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--env=FILENAME"
Load environment from FILENAME, usually hobbitserver.cfg.

.IP "--debug"
Dont send a message to hobbitd, but dump the message to
stdout.
