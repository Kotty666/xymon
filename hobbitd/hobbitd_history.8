.TH HOBBITD_HISTORY 8 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
hobbitd_history \- hobbitd worker module for logging status changes 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "hobbitd_channel --channel=stachg hobbitd_history [options]"

.SH DESCRIPTION
hobbitd_history is a worker module for hobbitd, and as such it is normally
run via the
.I hobbitd_channel(8)
program. It receives hobbitd status-change messages from the "stachg" 
channel via stdin, and uses these to update the history logfiles in a manner 
that is compatible with the standard Big Brother daemon, bbd.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--histdir=DIRECTORY"
The directory for the history files. If not specified, the
directory given by the BBHIST environment is used.

.IP "--histlogdir=DIRECTORY"
The directory for the historical status-logs. If not specified, the
directory given by the BBHISTLOGS environment is used.

.IP "--debug"
Enable debugging output.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.IP BBALLHISTLOG
This environment variable controls if the $BBHIST/allevents
logfile is updated. This file is used by the event-log display on the
BB2 html page. If you do not use this, you can disable it by setting
BBALLHISTLOGS=FALSE.

.IP BBHOSTHISTLOG
This environment variable controls if the $BBHIST/HOSTNAME
logfile is updated. This file holds a list of all status changes seen
for a single host, but is not used by any of the standard Xymon
tools. If you do not want to save this, you can disable it by setting
BBHOSTHISTLOG=FALSE.

.IP SAVESTATUSLOG
This environment variable controls if the historical
status-logs are saved whenever a status change occurs. These logfiles
are stored in the $BBHISTLOGS directory, and are used for the detailed
log-display of a status from the Xymon "History" page. If you
do not want to save these, you can disable it by setting SAVESTATUSLOG=FALSE.

.SH FILES
This module does not rely on any configuration files.
