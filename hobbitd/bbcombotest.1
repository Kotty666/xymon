.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBbbcombotest\fR
is a Xymon extension script that runs on the BBDISPLAY server. 
It combines the results of one or more of the normal
Xymon test results into a combined test result, using
standard arithmetic og logical operators.

The resulting tests are sent to the Xymon display server as any 
normal test - so all of the standard Xymon functions (history,
statistics etc.) are available for the combined tests.

The tool was born from the need to monitor systems with built-in
redundancy and automatic failover - e.g. load-balanced web servers.
But other uses are possible.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "--quiet"
Normally, the test status sent by bbcombotest includes information
about the underlying test results used to determine the current
value of the combined test. "--quiet" eliminates this information
from the test status page.

.IP "--debug"
Provide debugging output for use in troubleshooting problems with
bbcombotest.

.IP "--no-update"
Dont send any status messages - instead, the result of the combotests
is simply dumped to stdout. Useful for debugging.


.SH FILES
.IP $BBHOME/etc/bbcombotest.cfg
Configuration file for bbcombotest, where the combined tests are defined
.IP $BBHOME/etc/hobbitlaunch.cfg
