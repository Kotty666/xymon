Description: monitoring system for systems, networks and applications - server
 Hobbit is a network- and applications-monitoring system designed for use in
 large-scale networks. It will also work just fine on a small network with
 just a few nodes. It is low-overhead and high-performance, with an easy to use
 web front-end. It handles monitoring of network services, and through client
 packages it can also be used to monitor server-specific items. Alerts can
 trigger when monitoring detects a problem, resulting in e-mails or calls to
 your pager or mobile phone.
 .
 Hobbit has a great deal of inspiration from the non-free Big Brother package,
 but does not include any Big Brother code.

 This is the client data collection package for Hobbit. It gathers statistics
 and data from a single system and reports it to the Hobbit monitor. You should
 run this on all systems if you have a Hobbit server installed.
