_Description: Automatically migrate old hobbit files to xymon?
 The operating system user was renamed from "hobbit" to "xymon", and all
 configuration, state, log directories and files have been renamed as well.
 The package postinst scripts can do the migration automatically. This is
 usually a good idea, but might not work so well if your config differs
 substantially from the default.
