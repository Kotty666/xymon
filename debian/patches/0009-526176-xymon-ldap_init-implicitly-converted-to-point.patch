Subject: #526176: xymon: ldap_init implicitly converted to pointer

Our automated buildd log filter[1] detected a problem that is likely to
cause your package to segfault on architectures where the size of a
pointer is greater than the size of an integer, such as ia64 and amd64.

  Function `ldap_init' implicitly converted to pointer at test-ldap.c:25

  This is often due to a missing function prototype definition.
  For more information, see [2].

  Though it is guaranteed that this codepath will cause a segfault on certain
  architectures, it is not guaranteed that this codepath would ever be executed
  (e.g., if the returned pointer is never dereferenced). However, this bug
  does prevent the ia64 buildd from successfully building this package, resulting
  in a practical FTBFS issue and warranting the serious severity.

  The libldap API has been updated and many functions used by the ldap
  plugin are now deprecated. This package should either update to the
  new API or define LDAP_DEPRECATED to continue using the deprecated
  interfaces.

  This patch implements the lazy solution.
