Description: monitoring system for systems, networks and applications
 Xymon (previously called Hobbit) is a network- and applications-
 monitoring system designed for use in large-scale networks. But 
 it will also work just fine on a small network with just a few 
 nodes. It is low-overhead and high-performance, with an easy to
 use web front-end. It handles monitoring of network services, 
 and through client packages it can also be used to monitor server-
 specific items.  Alerts can trigger when monitoring detects a 
 problem, resulting in e-mails or calls to your pager or mobile 
 phone.
 .
 Xymon has a great deal of inspiration from the non-free Big Brother 
 package, but does not include any Big Brother code.

Description: client for the Xymon network monitor

 known as Hobbit). This gathers statistics and data from 
 a single system and reports it to the Xymon monitor. 
 You should run this on all systems if you have a Xymon 
 server installed.
