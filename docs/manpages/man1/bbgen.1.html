<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>bbgen</B>
generates the overview webpages for the Xymon monitor. These are the webpages
that show the overall status of your hosts, not the detailed status pages for 
each test.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS</H2>

bbgen has a large number of commandline options.  The options
can be used to change the behaviour of bbgen and affect the web pages generated 
by it.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>GENERAL OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--help or -?<DD>
Provide a summary of available commandline options.
<P>
<DT>--version<DD>
Prints the version number of bbgen
<P>
<DT>--docurl=URL<DD>
Make hostnames be hyperlinks to documentation, accessed via a common
web page (typically a CGI script or a PHP-driven dynamic page). The URL 
parameter is a formatting string with the name of the web page - you can 
put a &quot;%s&quot; in it which will be replaced by the hostname being accessed. 
E.g. if you use the bb-notes extension from <A HREF="http://www.deadcat.net">www.deadcat.net</A>, you would
enable this with &quot;--docurl=/xymon/admin/notes.php?host=%s&quot;. For the host 
<A HREF="http://www.storner.dk">www.storner.dk</A> this will result in a link to 
&quot;/xymon/admin/notes.php?host=<A HREF="http://www.storner.dk">www.storner.dk</A>&quot;. 
<P>
<DT>--doccgi=URL<DD>
This option is deprecated; please use --docurl instead.
<P>
<DT>--no-doc-window<DD>
By default, links to documentation for hosts and services cause a new
window to appear with the information. With this option, the documentation
will appear in the same window as the Xymon status.
<P>
<DT>--htmlextension=.EXTENSION<DD>
Sets the filename extension used for the webpages generated by bbgen. 
By default, an extension of &quot;.html&quot; is used.  Note that you need to 
specify the &quot;dot&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--report[=COLUMNNAME]<DD>
With this option, bbgen will send a status message with details of how 
many hosts were processed, how many pages were generated, any errors 
that occurred during the run, and some timing statistics. The default 
columnname is &quot;bbgen&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--htaccess[=htaccess-filename]<DD>
Create .htaccess files when new web page directories are created. The 
content of the .htaccess files are determined by the BBHTACCESS environment 
variable (for the top-level directory with bb.html and bb2.html); by the 
BBPAGEHTACCESS variable (for the page-level directories); and by the 
BBSUBPAGEHTACCESS variable for subpage- and subparent-level directories.
The filename of the .htaccess files default to &quot;.htaccess&quot; if no filename
is given with this option.
The BBHTACCESS variable is copied verbatim into the top-level .htaccess file.
The BBPAGEHTACCESS variable may contain a &quot;%s&quot; where the name of the
page is inserted.
The BBSUBPAGEHTACCESS variable may contain two &quot;%s&quot; instances: The first is
replaced with the pagename, the second with the subpagename.
<P>
<DT>--max-eventcount=N<DD>
Limit the eventlog on the BB2 page to only N events. Default: 100.
<P>
<DT>--max-eventtime=N<DD>
Limit the eventlog on the BB2 page to events that happened within
the past N minutes. Default: 240.
<P>
<DT>--no-eventlog<DD>
Disable the eventlog normally displayed on the BB2 page
<P>
<DT>--max-ackcount=N<DD>
Limit the acknowledgment log on the BB2 page to only N events. Default: 25.
<P>
<DT>--max-acktime=N<DD>
Limit the acknowledgment log on the BB2 page to acks that happened within
the past N minutes. Default: 240.
<P>
<DT>--no-acklog<DD>
Disable the acknowledgement log normally displayed on the BB2 page.
<P>
<DT>--nklog[=NK log column]<DD>
This generates a text-based log of what is shown on the bbnk.html
status page, and sends a status message for the BBDISPLAY server itself
reflecting the color of the NK status page. This allows you to track
when problems have appeared on the bbnk status page. The logfile is
stored in $BBHOME/nkstatus.log
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PAGE LAYOUT OPTIONS</H2>

These options affect how the webpages generated by bbgen appear in the
browser.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--pages-last<DD>
Put page- and subpage-links after hosts.
<DT>--pages-first<DD>
Put page- and subpage-links before hosts (default).
<P>
These two options decide whether a page with links to subpages and hosts 
have the hosts or the subpages first.
<P>
<DT>--subpagecolumns=N<DD>
Determines the number of columns used for links to pages 
and subpages. The default is N=1.
<P>
<DT>--maxrows=N<DD>
Column headings on a page are by default only shown at the beginning
of a page, subpage or group of hosts. This options causes the column
headings to repeat for every N hosts shown.
<P>
<DT>--pagetitle-links<DD>
Normally, only the colored &quot;dots&quot; next to a page or subpage act as links
to the page itself. With this option, the page title will link to the
page also.
<P>
<DT>--pagetext-headings<DD>
Use the description text from the &quot;page&quot; or &quot;subpage&quot; tags as a heading
for the page, instead of the &quot;Pages hosted locally&quot; or other standard
heading.
<P>
<DT>--no-underline-headings<DD>
Normally, page headings are underlined using an HTML &quot;horizontal ruler&quot;
tag. This option disables the underlining of headings.
<P>
<DT>--recentgifs[=MINUTES]<DD>
Use images named COLOR-recent.gif for tests, where the test status
has changed within the past 24 hours. These GIF files need to be installed
in the $BBHOME/www/gifs/ directory. By default, the threshold is set to 24
hours - if you want it differently, you can specify the time limit also.
E.g. &quot;--recentgifs=3h&quot; will show the recent GIFs for only 3 hours after
a status change.
<P>
<DT>--sort-group-only-items<DD>
In a normal &quot;group-only&quot; directive, you can specify the order in which the
tests are displayed, from left to right. If you prefer to have the tests
listed in alphabetical order, use this option - the page will then generate
&quot;group-only&quot; groups like it generates normal groups, and sort the tests
alphabetically.
<P>
<DT>--dialupskin=URL<DD>
If you want to visually show that a test is a dialup-test, you can use
an alternate set of icons for the green/red/yellow&gt;/etc. images by
specifying this option. The URL parameter specified here overrides the
normal setting from the BBSKIN environment variable, but only for dialup
tests.
<P>
<DT>--reverseskin=URL<DD>
Same as &quot;--dialupskin&quot;, but for reverse tests (tests with '!' in front).
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COLUMN SELECTION OPTIONS</H2>

These options affect which columns (tests) are included in the webpages
generated by bbgen.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--ignorecolumns=test[,test]<DD>
The given columns will be completely ignored by bbgen when generating 
webpages. Can be used to generate reports where you eliminate
some of the more noisy tests, like &quot;msgs&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--nk-reds-only<DD>
Only red status columns will be included on the NK page. By default,
the NK page will contain hosts with red, yellow and clear status.
<P>
<DT>--bb2colors=COLOR[,COLOR]<DD>
Defines which colors cause a test to appear on the &quot;All non-green&quot;
status page (a.k.a. the BB2 page). COLOR is red, yellow or purple.
The default is to include all three.
<P>
<DT>--bb2-ignorecolumns=test[,test]<DD>
Same as the --ignorecolumns, but applies to hosts on the BB2 page only.
<P>
<DT>--bb2-ignorepurples<DD>
Deprecated, use &quot;--bb2colors&quot; instead.
<P>
<DT>--bb2-ignoredialups<DD>
Ignore all dialup hosts on the BB2 page, including the BB2 eventlog.
<P>
<DT>--includecolumns=test[,test]<DD>
Always include these columns on bb2 page Will include certain columns on 
the bb2.html page, regardless of its color. Normally, bb2.html drops a 
test-column, if all tests are green. This can be used e.g. to always have 
a link to the trends column (with the RRD graphs) from your bb2.html page.
<P>
<DT>--eventignore=test[,test]<DD>
Ignore these tests in the BB2 event log display.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>STATUS PROPAGATION OPTIONS</H2>

These options suppress the normal propagation of a status upwards in the
page hierarchy. Thus, you can have a test with status yellow or red, but still
have the entire page green. It is useful for tests that need not cause an alarm,
but where you still want to know the actual status.
These options set global defaults for all hosts; you can use the NOPROPRED
and NOPROPYELLOW tags in the 
<I><A HREF="../man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</A>(5)</I>

file to apply similar limits on a per-host basis.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--nopropyellow=test[,test] or --noprop=test[,test]<DD>
Disable upwards status propagation when YELLOW. The &quot;--noprop&quot; option
is deprecated and should not be used.
<P>
<DT>--noproppurple=test[,test]<DD>
Disable upwards status propagation when PURPLE.
<P>
<DT>--nopropred=test[,test]<DD>
Disable upwards status propagation when RED or YELLOW.
<P>
<DT>--nopropack=test[,test]<DD>
Disable upwards status propagation when status has been
acknowledged. If you want to disable all acked tests from
being propageted, use &quot;--nopropack=*&quot;.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PURPLE STATUS OPTIONS</H2>

Purple statuses occur when reporting of a test status stops.
A test status is valid for a limited amount of time - normally
30 minutes - and after this time, the test becomes purple.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--purplelog=FILENAME<DD>
Generate a logfile of all purple status messages.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ALTERNATE PAGESET OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--pageset=PAGESETNAME<DD>
Build webpages for an alternate pageset than the default. See
the PAGESETS section below.
<P>
<DT>--template=TEMPLATE<DD>
Use an alternate template for header and footer files. Typically used
together the the &quot;--pageset&quot; option; see the PAGESETS section below.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ALTERNATE OUTPUT FORMATS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--wml[=test1,test2,...]<DD>
This option causes bbgen to generate a set of WML &quot;card&quot; files that 
can be accessed by a WAP device (cell phone, PDA etc.) The generated 
files contain the hosts that have a RED or YELLOW status on tests 
specified.  This option can define the default tests to include - 
the defaults can be overridden or amended using the &quot;WML:&quot; or &quot;NK:&quot; 
tags in the
<I><A HREF="../man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</A>(5)</I>

file. If no tests are specified, all tests will be included.
<P>
<DT>--nstab=FILENAME<DD>
Generate an HTML file suitable for a Netscape 6/Mozilla sidebar
entry. To actually enable your users to obtain such a sidebar
entry, you need this Javascript code in a webpage (e.g. you can
include it in the $BBHOME/web/bb_header file):
<P>
&lt;SCRIPT TYPE=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
<BR>

&lt;!--
<BR>

function addNetscapePanel() {
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if&nbsp;((typeof&nbsp;window.sidebar&nbsp;==&nbsp;&quot;object&quot;)&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(typeof&nbsp;window.sidebar.addPanel&nbsp;==&nbsp;&quot;function&quot;))
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window.sidebar.addPanel&nbsp;(&quot;Xymon&quot;,&nbsp;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<A HREF="http://your.server.com/nstab.html">http://your.server.com/nstab.html</A>&quot;,&quot;&quot;);
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;alert(&quot;Sidebar&nbsp;only&nbsp;for&nbsp;Mozilla&nbsp;or&nbsp;Netscape&nbsp;6+&quot;);
<BR>

}
<BR>

//--&gt;
<BR>

&lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
<P>
and then you can include a &quot;Add this to sidebar&quot; link using this as a template:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;A&nbsp;HREF=&quot;javascript:addNetscapePanel();&quot;&gt;Add&nbsp;to&nbsp;Sidebar&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
or if you prefer to have the standard Netscape &quot;Add tab&quot; button, you 
would do it with
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;A&nbsp;HREF=&quot;javascript:addNetscapePanel();&quot;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;IMG&nbsp;SRC=&quot;/gifs/add-button.gif&quot;&nbsp;HEIGHT=45&nbsp;WIDTH=100
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALT=&quot;[Add&nbsp;Sidebar]&quot;&nbsp;STYLE=&quot;border:0&quot;&gt;
<BR>

<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/A&gt;
<P>
The &quot;add-button.gif&quot; is available from Netscape at
<A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/browser/sidebar/add-button.gif.">http://developer.netscape.com/docs/manuals/browser/sidebar/add-button.gif.</A>
<P>
If FILENAME does not begin with a slash, the Netscape sidebar file
is placed in the $BBHOME/www/ directory.
<P>
<DT>--nslimit=COLOR<DD>
The minimum color to include in the Netscape Sidebar - default is &quot;red&quot;,
meaning only critical alerts are included. If you want to include
warnings also, use &quot;--nslimit=yellow&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--rss<DD>
Generate RSS/RDF content delivery stream of your Xymon
alerts. This output format can be dynamically embedded in other web
pages, much like the live newsfeeds often seen on web sites. Two RSS files
will be generated, one reflects the BB2 page, the other reflects the BBNK
page. They will be in the &quot;bb2.rss&quot; and &quot;bbnk.rss&quot; files, respectively.
In addition, an RSS file will be generated for each page and/or subpage
listing the hosts present on that page or subpage.
<BR>

The FILENAME parameter previously allowed on the --rss option is now obsolete.
<BR>

For more information about RSS/RDF content feeds, please see 
<A HREF="http://www.syndic8.com/.">http://www.syndic8.com/.</A>
<P>
<DT>--rssextension=.EXTENSION<DD>
Sets the filename extension used for the RSS files generated by bbgen. 
By default, an extension of &quot;.rss&quot; is used.  Note that you need to 
specify the &quot;dot&quot;.
<P>
<DT>--rssversion={0.91|0.92|1.0|2.0}<DD>
The desired output format of the RSS/RDF feed. Version 0.91 appears to 
be the most commonly used format, and is the default if this option is
omitted.
<P>
<DT>--rsslimit=COLOR<DD>
The minimum color to include in the RSS feed - default is &quot;red&quot;,
meaning only critical alerts are included. If you want to include
warnings also, use &quot;--rsslimit=yellow&quot;.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAM">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>OPTIONS USED BY CGI FRONT-ENDS</H2>

<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--reportopts=START:END:DYNAMIC:STYLE<DD>
Invoke bbgen in report-generation mode. This is normally used by the
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-rep.cgi.1.html">bb-rep.cgi</A>(1)</I>

CGI script, but may also be used directly when pre-generating reports.
The START parameter is the start-time for the report in Unix time_t
format (seconds since Jan 1st 1970 00:00 UTC); END is the end-time for
the report; DYNAMIC is 0 for a pre-built report and 1 for a dynamic
(on-line) report; STYLE is &quot;crit&quot; to include only critical (red)
events, &quot;non-crit&quot; to include all non-green events, and &quot;all&quot; to
include all events.
<P>
<DT>--csv=FILENAME<DD>
Used together with --reportopts, this causes bbgen to generate an
availability report in the form of a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
This format is commonly used for importing into spreadsheets for further
processing.
<P>
<DT>--snapshot=TIME<DD>
Generate a snapshot of the Xymon pages, as they appeared at
TIME. TIME is given as seconds since Jan 1st 1970 00:00 UTC. Normally
used via the
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-snapshot.cgi.1.html">bb-snapshot.cgi</A>(1)</I>

CGI script.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAN">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DEBUGGING OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>--debug<DD>
Causes bbgen to dump large amounts of debugging output to stdout,
if it was compiled with the -DDEBUG enabled. When reporting a 
problem with bbgen, please try to reproduce the problem and
provide the output from running bbgen with this option.
<P>
<DT>--timing<DD>
Dump information about the time spent by various parts of bbgen
to stdout. This is useful to see what part of the processing is
responsible for the run-time of bbgen.
<BR>

Note: This information is also provided in the output sent to the 
Xymon display when using the &quot;--report&quot; option.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAO">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>BUILDING ALTERNATE PAGESETS</H2>

With version 1.4 of bbgen comes the possibility to generate
multiple sets of pages from the same data.
<BR>

Suppose you have two groups of people looking at the BB
webpages.  Group A wants to have the hosts grouped by the client, 
they belong to. This is how you have Xymon set up - the default pageset.
Now group B wants to have the hosts grouped by operating system - 
let us call it the &quot;os&quot; set.  Then you would add the page layout to 
bb-hosts like this:
<P>
ospage    win          Microsoft Windows
<BR>

ossubpage   win-nt4      MS Windows NT 4
<BR>

osgroup NT4 File servers
<BR>

osgroup NT4 Mail servers
<BR>

ossubpage   win-xp       MS Windows XP
<BR>

ospage    unix         Unix
<BR>

ossubpage   unix-sun     Solaris
<BR>

ossubpage   unix-linux   Linux
<P>
This defines a set of pages with one top-level page (the
bb.html page), two pages linked from bb.html (win.html 
and unix.html), and from e.g. the win.html page there are
subpages win-nt4.html and win-xp.html
<BR>

The syntax is identical to the normal &quot;page&quot; and &quot;subpage&quot;
directives in bb-hosts, but the directive is prefixed with
the pageset name. Dont put any hosts in-between the page
and subpage directives - just add all the directives at
the top of the bb-hosts file.
<BR>

How do you add hosts to the pages, then ? Simple - just put
a tag &quot;OS:win-xp&quot; on the host definition line. The &quot;OS&quot; 
must be the same as prefix used for the pageset names, 
but in uppercase. The &quot;win-xp&quot; must match one of the 
pages or subpages defined within this pageset.  E.g.
<P>
207.46.249.190  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</A> # OS:win-xp <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/">http://www.microsoft.com/</A>
<BR>

64.124.140.181  <A HREF="http://www.sun.com">www.sun.com</A> # OS:unix-sun <A HREF="http://www.sun.com/">http://www.sun.com/</A>
<P>
If you want the host to appear inside a group defined on 
that page, you must identify the group by number, starting
at 1. E.g. to put a host inside the &quot;NT4 Mail servers&quot;
group in the example above, use &quot;OS:win-nt4,2&quot; (the 
second group on the &quot;win-nt4&quot; page).
<BR>

If you want the host to show up on the frontpage instead
of a subpage, use &quot;OS:*&quot; .
<P>
All of this just defines the layout of the new pageset.
To generate it, you must run bbgen once for each pageset
you define - i.e. create an extension script like this:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DD>
<PRE>
#!/bin/sh

BBWEB=&quot;/xymon/os&quot; $BBHOME/bin/bbgen \
        --pageset=os --template=os \
        $BBHOME/www/os/
</PRE>

</DL>
<P>

Save this to $BBHOME/ext/os-display.sh, and set this up to run as
a Xymon extension; this means addng an extra section to hobbitlaunch.cfg
to run it.
<P>
This generates the pages. There are some important options used here:
<BR>

* BBWEB=&quot;/xymon/os&quot; environment variable, and the 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;$BBHOME/www/os/&quot;&nbsp;option&nbsp;work&nbsp;together,&nbsp;and&nbsp;places&nbsp;the&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;new&nbsp;pageset&nbsp;HTML&nbsp;files&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;subdirectory&nbsp;off&nbsp;the&nbsp;normal&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Xymon&nbsp;webroot.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;normally&nbsp;access&nbsp;the&nbsp;Xymon&nbsp;pages&nbsp;as&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;<A HREF="http://xymon.acme.com/xymon/">http://xymon.acme.com/xymon/</A>&quot;,&nbsp;you&nbsp;will&nbsp;then&nbsp;access&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;pageset&nbsp;as&nbsp;&quot;<A HREF="http://xymon.acme.com/xymon/os/">http://xymon.acme.com/xymon/os/</A>&quot;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;NB:&nbsp;The&nbsp;directory&nbsp;given&nbsp;as&nbsp;BBWEB&nbsp;must&nbsp;contain&nbsp;a&nbsp;symbolic&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;link&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;$BBHOME/www/html/&nbsp;directory,&nbsp;or&nbsp;links&nbsp;to&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;individual&nbsp;status&nbsp;messages&nbsp;will&nbsp;not&nbsp;work.&nbsp;Similar&nbsp;links&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;made&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;gifs/,&nbsp;help/&nbsp;and&nbsp;notes/&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;directories.
<BR>

* &quot;--pageset=os&quot; tells bbgen to structure the webpages 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;using&nbsp;the&nbsp;&quot;os&quot;&nbsp;layout,&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;default&nbsp;layout.
<BR>

* &quot;--template=os&quot; tells bbgen to use a different set of 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;header-&nbsp;and&nbsp;footer-templates.&nbsp;Normally&nbsp;bbgen&nbsp;uses&nbsp;the&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;standard&nbsp;template&nbsp;in&nbsp;$BBHOME/web/bb_header&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;.../bb_footer&nbsp;-&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;option,&nbsp;it&nbsp;will&nbsp;instead&nbsp;use&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;the&nbsp;files&nbsp;&quot;os_header&quot;&nbsp;and&nbsp;&quot;os_footer&quot;&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;$BBHOME/web/&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;This&nbsp;allows&nbsp;you&nbsp;to&nbsp;customize&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;headers&nbsp;and&nbsp;footers&nbsp;for&nbsp;each&nbsp;pageset.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;just&nbsp;want&nbsp;
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;use&nbsp;the&nbsp;normal&nbsp;template,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;omit&nbsp;this&nbsp;option.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAP">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>USING BBGEN FOR REPORTS</H2>

bbgen reporting is implemented via drop-in replacements for the
standard Xymon reporting scripts (bb-rep.sh and bb-replog.sh) installed 
in your webservers cgi-bin directory.
<P>
These two shell script have been replaced with two very small
shell-scripts, that merely setup the Xymon environment variables,
and invoke the 
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-rep.cgi.1.html">bb-rep.cgi</A>(1)</I>

or
<I><A HREF="../man1/bb-replog.cgi.1.html">bb-replog.cgi</A>(1)</I>

scripts in $BBHOME/bin/
<P>
You can use bbgen commandline options when generating reports,
e.g. to exclude certain types of tests (e.g. &quot;--ignorecolumns=msgs&quot;) 
from the reports, to specify the name of the trends- and info-
columns that should not be in the report, or to format the report 
differently (e.g. &quot;--subpagecolumns=2&quot;). If you want certain
options to be used when a report is generated from the web
interface, put these options into your $BBHOME/etc/hobbitserver.cfg
file in the BBGENREPOPTS environment variable.
<P>
The report files generated by bbgen are stored in individual 
directories (one per report) below the $BBHOME/www/rep/ directory.
These should be automatically cleaned up - as new reports are
generated, the old ones get removed.
<P>
After installing, try generating a report. You will probably see that
the links in the upper left corner (to bb-ack.html, bb2.html etc.)
no longer works. To fix these, change your $BBHOME/web/bbrep_header
file so these links do not refer to &quot;&amp;BBWEB&quot; but to the normal 
URL prefix for your Xymon pages.

<H2>SLA REPORTING</H2>

bbgen reporting allows for the generation of true SLA (Service
Level Agreement) reports, also for service periods that are not
24x7. This is enabled by defining a &quot;REPORTTIME:timespec&quot; tag
for the hosts to define the service period, and optionally a 
&quot;WARNPCT:level&quot; tag to define the agreed availability.
<P>
Note: See 
<I><A HREF="../man5/bb-hosts.5.html">bb-hosts</A>(5)</I>

for the exact syntax of these options.
<P>
&quot;REPORTTIME:timespec&quot; specifies the time of day when the service
is expected to be up and running. By default this is 24 hours 
a day, all days of the week. If your SLA only covers Mon-Fri
7am - 8pm, you define this as &quot;REPORTTIME=W:0700:2000&quot;, and the
report generator will then compute both the normal 24x7 availability
but also a &quot;SLA availability&quot; which only takes the status of the
host during the SLA period into account.
<P>
The DOWNTIME:timespec parameter affects the SLA availability
calculation. If an outage occurs during the time defined as
possible &quot;DOWNTIME&quot;, then the failure is reported with a status
of &quot;blue&quot;. (The same color is used if you &quot;disable&quot; then host
using the Xymon &quot;disable&quot; function). The time when the 
test status is &quot;blue&quot; is not included in the SLA calculation,
neither in the amount of time where the host is considered down,
nor in the total amount of time that the report covers. So
&quot;blue&quot; time is effectively ignored by the SLA availability 
calculation, allowing you to have planned downtime without
affecting the reported SLA availability.
<P>
Example: A host has &quot;DOWNTIME:*:0700:0730 REPORTTIME=W:0600:2200&quot;
because it is rebooted every day between 7am and 7.30am, but the
service must be available from 6am to 10pm. For the day of the
report, it was down from 7:10am to 7:15am (the planned reboot),
but also from 9:53pm to 10:15pm. So the events for the day are:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0700&nbsp;:&nbsp;green&nbsp;for&nbsp;10&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;(600&nbsp;seconds)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0710&nbsp;:&nbsp;blue&nbsp;for&nbsp;5&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;(300&nbsp;seconds)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0715&nbsp;:&nbsp;green&nbsp;for&nbsp;14&nbsp;hours&nbsp;38&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;(52680&nbsp;seconds)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2153&nbsp;:&nbsp;red&nbsp;for&nbsp;22&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;(1320&nbsp;seconds)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2215&nbsp;:&nbsp;green
<P>
The service is available for 600+52680 = 53280 seconds. It is
down (red) for 420 seconds (the time from 21:53 until 22:00 when
the SLA period ends). The total time included in the report is
15 hours (7am - 10pm) except the 5 minutes blue = 53700 seconds.
So the SLA availability is 53280/53700 = 99,22%
<P>
The &quot;WARNPCT:level&quot; tag is supported in the bb-hosts file, to set
the availability threshold on a host-by-host basis. This threshold
determines whether a test is reported as green, yellow or red in
the reports. A default value can be set for all hosts with the via 
the BBREPWARN environment variable, but overridden by this tag.
The level is given as a percentage, e.g. &quot;WARNPCT:98.5&quot;
<P>

<A NAME="lbAR">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>PRE-GENERATED REPORTS</H2>

Normally, bbgen produce reports that link to dynamically generated
webpages with the detailed status of a test (via the bb-replog.sh
CGI script).
<P>
It is possible to have bbgen produce a report without these
dynamic links, so the report can be exported to another server.
It may also be useful to pre-generate the reports, to lower the
load by having multiple users generate the same reports.
<P>
To do this, you must run bbgen with the &quot;--reportopts&quot; option 
to select the time interval that the report covers, the reporting
style (critical, non-green, or all events), and to request that
no dynamic pages are to be generated.
<P>
The syntax is:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bbgen&nbsp;--reportopts=starttime:endtime:nodynamic:style
<P>
&quot;starttime&quot; and &quot;endtime&quot; are specified as Unix time_t values,
i.e. seconds since Jan 1st 1970 00:00 GMT. Fortunately, this 
can easily be computed with the GNU date utility if you use
the &quot;+%s&quot; output option. If you don't have the GNU date
utility, either pick that up from <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">www.gnu.org</A>; or you can
use the &quot;etime&quot; utility for the same purpose, which is
available from the archive at <A HREF="http://www.deadcat.net">www.deadcat.net</A>.
<P>
&quot;nodynamic&quot; is either 0 (for dynamic pages, the default) or
1 (for no dynamic, i.e. pre-generated, pages).
<P>
&quot;style&quot; is either &quot;crit&quot; (include critical i.e. red events only),
&quot;nongr&quot; (include all non-green events), or &quot;all&quot; (include all
events).
<P>
Other bbgen options can be used, e.g. &quot;--ignorecolumns&quot; if you 
want to exclude certain tests from the report.
<P>
You will normally also need to specify the BBWEB environment 
variable (it must match the base URL for where the report will
be made accessible from), and an output directory where the
report files are saved.  If you specify BBWEB, you should probably
also define the BBHELPSKIN and BBNOTESSKIN environment variables. 
These should point to the URL where your Xymon help- and notes-files 
are located; if they are not defined, the links to help- and
notes-files will point inside the report directory and will
probably not work.
<P>
So a typical invocation of bbgen for a static report would be:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;START=`date&nbsp;+%s&nbsp;--date=&quot;22&nbsp;Jun&nbsp;2003&nbsp;00:00:00&quot;`
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;END=`date&nbsp;+%s&nbsp;--date=&quot;22&nbsp;Jun&nbsp;2003&nbsp;23:59:59&quot;`
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;BBWEB=/reports/bigbrother/daily/2003/06/22&nbsp;\
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;BBHELPSKIN=/xymon/help&nbsp;\
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;BBNOTESSKIN=/xymon/notes&nbsp;\
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;bbgen&nbsp;--reportopts=$START:$END:1:crit&nbsp;\
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--subpagecolumns=2&nbsp;\
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/var/www/docroot/reports/xymon/daily/2003/06/22
<P>
The &quot;BBWEB&quot; setting means that the report will be available with
a URL of &quot;<A HREF="http://www.server.com/reports/xymon/daily/2003/06/22">http://www.server.com/reports/xymon/daily/2003/06/22</A>&quot;.
The report contains internal links that use this URL, so it cannot
be easily moved to another location.
<P>
The last parameter is the corresponding physical directory on your
webserver matching the BBWEB URL. You can of course create the report
files anywhere you like - perhaps on another machine - and then move
them to the webserver later on.
<P>
Note how the 
<I><A HREF="../man1/date.1.html">date</A>(1)</I>

utility is used to calculate the start- and end-time parameters.
