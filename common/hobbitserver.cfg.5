.TH HOBBITSERVER.CFG 5 "Version 4.2.3:  4 Feb 2009" "Xymon"
.SH NAME
hobbitserver.cfg \- Xymon environment variables

.SH DESCRIPTION
Xymon programs use multiple environment variables beside the
normal set of variables.  The environment definitions
are stored in the ~Xymon/server/etc/hobbitserver.cfg file. 
Each line in this file is of the form \fBNAME=VALUE\fR and defines
one environment variable NAME with the value VALUE.

.SH ENVIRONMENT AREAS
In some cases it may be useful to have different values for an environment
variable, depending on where it is used. This is possible by defining
variables with an associated "area". Such definitions have the form
\fBAREA/NAME=VALUE\fR.

E.g. to define a special setup of the BBDISPLAY variable when it is used
by an application in the "management" area, you would do this:
.IP
.nf
  BBDISP="127.0.0.1"            # Default definition
  management/BBDISP="10.1.0.5"  # Definition in the "management" area
.fi
.LP
Areas are invoked by using the "--area" option for all tools, or via the 
ENVAREA setting in the
.I hobbitlaunch.cfg(5)
file.

.SH GENERAL SETTINGS

.IP BBSERVERHOSTNAME
The fully-qualified hostname of the server that is running Xymon.

.IP BBSERVERWWWNAME
The hostname used to access this servers' web-pages, used to construct
URL's in the Xymon webpages. Default is the BBSERVERHOSTNAME.

.IP BBSERVERIP
The public IP-address of the server that is running Xymon.

.IP BBSERVEROS
A name identifying the operating system of the Xymon server. The 
known names are currently "linux", "freebsd", "solaris", "hpux",
"aix" and "osf".

.IP FQDN
If set to TRUE, Xymon will use fully-qualified hostnames throughout.
If set to FALSE, hostnames are stripped of their domain-part before
being processed. It is \fBhighly recommended\fR that you keep this
set to TRUE. Default: TRUE.

.IP BBLOGSTATUS
Controls how the HTML page for a status log is generated. If set to
DYNAMIC, the HTML logs are generated on-demand by the 
.I bb-hostsvc.cgi(1)
script. If set to STATIC, you must activate the
.I hobbitd_filestore(8)
module (through an entry in the
.I hobbitlaunch.cfg(5)
file) to create and store the HTML logs whenever a status update is
received. Setting "BBLOGSTATUS=STATIC" is \fBdiscouraged\fR since the
I/O load on the Xymon server will increase significantly.

.IP PINGCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for "ping" test status. The data from
the "ping" test is used internally by Xymon, so it must be defined
here so all of the Xymon tools know which column to watch for this 
data. The default setting is PINGCOLUMN=conn.

.IP INFOCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for the "info" pages.

.IP TRENDSCOLUMN
Defines the name of the column for the RRD graph pages.

.IP RRDHEIGHT
The default height (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.
Default: 120 pixels.

.IP RRDWIDTH
The default width (in pixels) of the RRD graph images.
Default: 576 pixels.

.IP TRENDSECONDS
The graphs on the "trends" page show data for the past TRENDSECONDS
seconds. Default: 172800 seconds, i.e. 48 hours.

.IP HTMLCONTENTTYPE
The Content-type reported by the CGI scripts that generate web pages.
By default, this it "text/html". If you have on-line help texts in
character sets other than the ISO-8859-1 (western european) character
set, it may be necessary to modify this to include a character set.
E.g.
.br
   HTMLCONTENTTYPE="text/html; charset=euc-jp"
.br
for a Japanese character sets. Note: Some webservers will automatically
add this, if configured to do so.

.IP HOLIDAYS
Defines the default set of holidays used if there is no "holidays" 
tag for a host in the bb-hosts file. Holiday sets are defined in the
.I hobbit-holidays.cfg(5)
file. If not defined, only the default holidays (those defined outside
a named holiday set) will be considered as holidays.

.IP WEEKSTART
Defines which day is the first day of the week. Set to "0" for Sunday,
"1" for Monday. Default: 1 (Monday).

CGI script to generate reports on-demand. Default: $BBHOME/www/rep/

.IP BBSNAP
Directory for Xymon snapshots. The $BBSNAPURL URL must map to this directory.
Note also that your webserver must have write-access to this directory, if you want to
use the

.IP COLUMNDOCURL
Format string used to build a link to the documentation for a column heading.
Default: "$CGIBINURL/hobbitcolumn.sh?%s", which causes links to use the
.I hobbitcolumn.sh(1)
script to document a column.


.SH SETTINGS FOR SENDING MESSAGES TO HOBBIT
.IP BBDISP
The IP-address used to contact the
.I hobbitd(8)
service. Used by clients and the tools that perform network tests.
Default: $BBSERVERIP

.IP BBDISPLAYS
List of IP-adresses. Clients and network test tools will try to
send status reports to a Xymon server running on each of these
adresses. This setting is only used if BBDISP=0.0.0.0.

.IP PAGELEVELS
Compatibility setting for Big Brother: List of colors that are 
considered "critical" and therefore will trigger an alert. Not
used by Xymon.

.IP BBPAGE
Compatibility setting for Big Brother: This is the IP-address of
the server where a BBPAGER service is running. It is not used by Xymon.

.IP BBPAGERS
Compatibility setting for Big Brother: List of servers running the
BBPAGER service, used if BBPAGE=0.0.0.0. It is not used by Xymon.

.IP BBPORT
The portnumber for used to contact the
.I hobbitd(8)
service. Used by clients and the tools that perform network tests.
Default: 1984.

.IP DOCOMBO
Compatibility setting for Big Brother. Controls whether so send 
combo-messages or not. Ignored by Xymon.

.IP BBMAXMSGSPERCOMBO
The maximum number of status messages to combine into one
combo message. You may need to lower this number of your
BBDISPLAY server has trouble keeping up with the incoming
status messages from bbtest-net.  Default: 100.

.IP BBSLEEPBETWEENMSGS
Length of a pause introduced between each successive transmission
of a combo-message by bbtest-net. You may have to increase this
value to give your BBDISPLAY server time to process one combo
message before the next one arrives. This number defines how
many microseconds to wait between the messages.
Default: 0 (send messages as quickly as possible).


.SH HOBBITD SETTINGS

.IP ALERTCOLORS
Comma-separated list of the colors that may trigger an alert-message.
The default is "red,yellow,purple". Note that alerts may further be
generated or suppresed based on the configuration in the
.I hobbit-alerts.cfg(5)
file.

.IP OKCOLORS
Comma-separated list of the colors that may trigger a recovery-message.
The default is "green,clear,blue".

.IP ALERTREPEAT
How often alerts get repeated while a status is in an alert state.
This is the default setting, which may be changed in the 
.I hobbit-alerts.cfg(5)
file.

.IP BBGHOSTS
Controls how status messages from unknown hosts (i.e. hosts not
listed in the bb-hosts file) are handled.
.sp
.BR BBGHOSTS=1:
Causes the status report to be silently discarded. This is the
default behaviour in Xymon.
.sp
.BR BBGHOSTS=2: 
Discards the status report, but keep track of the hostname
and report it on the hobbitd status page.
.sp
When BBGHOSTS is set to 1 or 2, the hostnames in incoming 
status-messages is matched without any case-sensitivity,
unlike normal Big Brother which is case-sensitive in
hostnames. So with BBGHOSTS set to 1 or 2, "WWW.FOO.COM"
and "www.foo.com" are considered to be the same host.
If necessary, the incoming hostname will be changed
to match the way it is written in the bb-hosts file,
changing case as needed.

.IP MAXMSG_STATUS
The maximum size of a "status" message in kB, default: 256.
Status messages are the ones that end up as columns on the 
web display. The default size should be adequate in most
cases, but some extension scripts can generate very large
status messages - close to 1024 kB. You should only change
this if you see messages in the hobbitd log file about status
messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_CLIENT
The maximum size of a "client" message in kB, default: 512.
"client" messages are generated by the Xymon client, and often
include large process-listings. You should only change
this if you see messages in the hobbitd log file about client
messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_DATA
The maximum size of a "data" message in kB, default: 256.
"data" messages are typically used for client reports of
e.g. netstat or vmstat data. You should only change this
setting if you see messages in the hobbitd log file about
data messages being truncated.

.IP MAXMSG_NOTES
The maximum size of a "notes" message in kB, default: 256.
"notes" messages provide a way for uploading documentation
about a host to Xymon; it is not enabled by default. If you 
want to upload large documents, you may need to change this
setting.

.IP MAXMSG_STACHG
The maximum size of a "status change" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS setting.  Status-change 
messages occur when a status changes color. There is no 
reason to change this setting.

.IP MAXMSG_PAGE
The maximum size of a "page" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_STATUS setting. "page" messages
are alerts, and include the status message that triggers the
alert. There is no reason to change this setting.

.IP MAXMSG_ENADIS
The maximum size of an "enadis" message in kB, default: 32.
"enadis" are small messages used when enabling or disabling
hosts and tests, so the default size should be adequate.

.IP MAXMSG_CLICHG
The maximum size of a "client change" message in kB, default: 
Current value of the MAXMSG_CLIENT setting.  Client-change 
messages occur when a status changes color to one of the
alert-colors, usually red, yellow and purple. There is no 
reason to change this setting.


.SH HOBBITD_HISTORY SETTINGS

.IP BBALLHISTLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I hobbitd_history(8)
will update the $BBHIST/allevents file logging all changes to
a status. The allevents file is used by the
.I bb-eventlog.cgi(1)
tool to show the list of recent events on the BB2 webpage.

.IP BBHOSTHISTLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I hobbitd_history(8)
will update the host-specific eventlog that keeps record
of all status changes for a host. This logfile is not used
by any Xymon tool.

.IP SAVESTATUSLOG
If set to TRUE,
.I hobbitd_history(8)
will save historical detailed status-logs to the $BBHISTLOGS
directory.


.SH HOBBITD_ALERT SETTINGS

.IP MAIL
Command used to send alerts via e-mail, including a "Subject:"
header in the mail. Default: "mail -s"

.IP MAILC
Command used to send alerts via e-mail in a form that does not
have a "Subject" in the mail. Default: "mail"

.IP SVCCODES
Maps status-columns to numeric service-codes. The numeric codes are
used when sending an alert using a script, where the numeric code of
the service is provided in the BBSVCNUM variable.


.SH HOBBITD_RRD SETTINGS

.IP TEST2RRD
List of "COLUMNNAME[=RRDSERVICE]" settings, that define which
status- and data-messages have a corresponding RRD graph. You will 
normally not need to modify this, unless you have added a
custom TCP-based test to the bb-services file, and want to collect data about
the response-time, OR if you are using the
.I hobbitd_rrd(8)
external script mechanism to collect data from custom tests. 
Note: All TCP tests are automatically added.

This is also used by the 
.I bb-hostsvc.cgi(1) 
script to determine if the detailed status view of a test should 
include a graph.

.IP GRAPHS
List of the RRD databases, that should be shown as a graph on
the "trends" column.

.IP NORRDDISKS
This is used to disable the tracking of certain filesystems. By default
all filesystems reported by a client are tracked. In some cases you may want 
to disable this for certain filesystems, e.g. database filesystems since they
are always completely full. This setting is a regular expression that is matched
against the filesystem name (the Unix mount-point, or the Windows disk-letter) -
if the filesystem name matches this expression, then it will not be tracked
by Xymon.
.br
Note: Setting this does not affect filesystems that are already being tracked
by Xymon - to remove them, you must remove the RRD files for the unwanted filesystems
from the ~xymon/data/rrd/HOSTNAME/ directory.

.IP RRDDISKS
This is used to enable tracking of only selected filesystems (see the NORRDDISKS
setting above). By default all filesystems are being tracked, setting this changes 
that default so that only those filesystems that match this pattern will be 
tracked.


.SH BBTEST-NET NETWORK TEST SETTINGS

.IP BBLOCATION
If this variable is defined, then only the hosts that have been tagged
with "NET:$BBLOCATION" will be tested by the bbtest-net tool.

.IP CONNTEST
If set to TRUE, the connectivity (ping) test will be performed.

.IP IPTEST_2_CLEAR_ON_FAILED_CONN
If set to TRUE, then failing network tests go CLEAR if the conn-test fails.

.IP NONETPAGE
List of network services (separated with <space>) that should go yellow
upon failure instead of red.

.IP BBROUTERTEXT
When using the "router" or "depends" tags for a host, a failure
status will include text that an "Intermediate router is down".
With todays network topologies, the router could be a switch or
another network device; if you define this environment variable
the word "router" will be replaced with whatever you put into
the variable. So to inform the users that an intermediate switch
or router is down, use BBROUTERTEXT="switch or router".  This can 
also be set on a per-host basis using the "DESCR:hosttype:description"
tag in the 
.I bb-hosts(5)
file.

.IP NETFAILTEXT
When a network test fails, the status message reports "SERVICENAME
not OK". The "not OK" message can be changed via this variable, e.g.
you can change it to "FAILED" or customize it as you like.

.IP FPING
The command used to run the
.I hobbitping(1)
tool for the connectivity test. (The name FPING is due to the fact that
the "fping" utility was used until Xymon version 4.2). This may include 
suid-root wrappers and hobbitping options.
Default: "hobbitping"

.IP TRACEROUTE
Defines the location of the "traceroute" tool and
any options needed to run it. traceroute it used by
the connectivity test when the ping test fails; if
requested via the "trace" tag, the TRACEROUTE command
is executed to try to determine the point in the
network that is causing the problem. By default the
command executed is "traceroute -n -q 2 -w 2 -m 15"
(no DNS lookup, max. 2 probes, wait 2 seconds per hop,
max 15 hops).
.sp
If you have the
.I mtr(8)
tool installed - available from http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/ - I
strongly recommend using this instead. The recommended
setting for mtr is "/usr/sbin/mtr -c 2 -n --report" (the
exact path to the mtr utility may be different on your 
system).  Note that mtr needs to be installed suid-root 
on most systems.

.IP NTPDATE
Defines the 
.I ntpdate(1)
program used for the "ntp" test.  
Default: "ntpdate"

.IP RPCINFO
Defines the
.I rpcinfo(8)
program used for "rpc" tests.
Default: "rpcinfo"


.SH BBGEN WEBPAGE GENERATOR SETTINGS

.IP HOBBITLOGO
HTML code that is inserted on all standard headers. The default is to add
the text "Xymon" in the upper-left corner of the page, but you can easily 
replace this with e.g. a company logo. If you do, I suggest that you keep 
it at about 30-35 pixels high, and 100-150 pixels wide.

.IP MKBBLOCAL
The string "Pages hosted locally" that appears above all of the pages
linked from the main Xymon webpage.

.IP MKBBSUBLOCAL
The string "Subpages hosted locally" that appears above all of the sub-pages
linked from pages below the main Xymon webpage.

.IP MKBBREMOTE
The string "Remote status display" that appears about the summary
statuses displayed on the min Xymon webpage.

.IP MKBBTITLE
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to choose the font for 
titles of the webpages.

.IP MKBBROWFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to choose the font for 
row headings (hostnames) on the webpages.

.IP MKBBCOLFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to chose the font for
column headings (test names) on the webpages.

.IP MKBBACKFONT
HTML tags designed to go in a <FONT> tag, to chose the font for
the acknowledgement text displayed on the status-log HTML page
for an acknowledged status.

.IP ACKUNTILMSG
When displaying the detailed status of an acknowledged test,
Xymon will include the time that the acknowledge expires
using the print-format defined in this setting. You can define
the timeformat using the controls in your systems
.I strftime(3)
routine, and add the text suitable for your setup.

.IP BBDATEFORMAT
On webpages generated by bbgen, the default header includes
the current date and time. Normally this looks like "Tue Aug 24
21:59:47 2004". The BBDATEFORMAT controls the format of this
timestamp - you can define the format using the controls in the 
.I strftime(3)
routine. E.g. to have it show up as "2004-08-24 21:59:47 +0200"
you would set BBDATEFORMAT="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %z"

.IP HOLIDAYFORMAT
How holiday dates are displayed. The default is "%d/%m" which
show the day and month. American users may want to change this 
to "%m/%d" to suit their preferred date-display style. This
is a formatting string for the system
.I strftime(3)
routine, so any controls available for this routine may be used.

.IP MKBB2COLREPEAT
Inspired by Jeff Stoner's col_repeat_patch.tgz patch, this defines
the maximum number of rows before repeating the column headings
on a webpage. This sets the default value for the 
.I bbgen(1)
"--maxrows" option; if the command-line option is also specifed,
then it overrides this environment variable. Note that unlike
Jeff's patch, bbgen implements this for both the bb2.html page
and all other pages (bb.html, subpages, bbnk.html). 

.IP SUMMARY_SET_BKG
If set to TRUE, then summaries will affect the color of the
main Xymon webpage. Default: FALSE.

.IP DOTHEIGHT
The height (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.
Default: 16, which matches the default icons.

.IP DOTWIDTH
The width (in pixels) of the icons showing the color of a status.
Default: 16, which matches the default icons.

.IP CLIENTSVCS
List of the status logs fed by data from the Xymon client. These
status logs will - if there are Xymon client data available for
the host - include a link to the raw data sent by the client.
Default: cpu,disk,memory,procs,svcs.

.IP BBRSSTITLE
If defined, this is the title of the RSS/RDF documents generated when
.I bbgen(1)
is invoked with the "--rss" option. The default value is "Xymon Alerts".

.IP WMLMAXCHARS
Maximum size of a WAP/WML output "card" when generating these.
Default: 1500.

.IP BBMKBB2EXT
List of scripts to run as extensions to the BB2 page. Note that
two scripts, "eventlog.sh" and "acklog.sh" are handled specially:
They are handled internally by bbgen, but the script names must
be listed in this variable for this function to be enabled.

.IP BBHISTEXT
List of scripts to run as extensions to a history page.

.IP BBREPWARN
Default threshold for listing the availability as "critical" (red) when
generating the availability report. This can be set on a per-host basis
with the WARNPCT setting in
.I bb-hosts(5).
Default: 97 (percent)

.IP BBGENREPOPTS
Default bbgen options used for reports. This will typically include
such options as "--subpagecolumns", and also "--ignorecolumns" if 
you wish to exclude certain tests from reports by default.

.IP BBGENSNAPOPTS
Default bbgen options used by snapshots. This should be identical to
the options you normally used when building Xymon webpages.
